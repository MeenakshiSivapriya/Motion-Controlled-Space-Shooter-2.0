# Motion Controlled Space-Shooter-2.0

We have interfaced Unity with Microsoft Kinect so that this game can be played by mapping your body motions. Processing IDLE is used to monitor Kinect and we have used sockets to communicate those values to Unity.

This repository has a few more levels which I have added in addition to the level which is available in the Unity tutorials for the 2D game Space Shooter.
